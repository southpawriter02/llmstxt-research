> **Maintenance note:** When adding a new reference, check whether it's already listed here before creating a duplicate. If a source is only used in one deliverable and is unlikely to be reused, it's fine to cite it inline in that deliverable rather than adding it here. This list is for frequently-cited or cross-deliverable references.
