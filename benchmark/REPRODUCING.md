# Reproducing the Benchmark Study

**Status:** 🔲 Not started — will be written alongside data collection (Phase 3)

---

> This document will provide step-by-step instructions for reproducing the benchmark results, including hardware requirements, software setup, and verification procedures.
>
> For the study overview and methodology, see [README.md](README.md) and [methodology.md](methodology.md).
> For the full experimental design rationale, see the [project proposal](../PROPOSAL.md) (Project 3 section).

<!-- TODO: Write reproducibility instructions. Sections to include:

  1. Hardware Requirements
     - Full replication: Mac Studio M3 Ultra (512GB unified memory) or equivalent
     - Analysis-only replication: any machine with Python 3.10+

  2. Phase 1 Replication (Data Collection — C#)
     - .NET 8 SDK installation
     - LlmsTxtKit setup and configuration
     - Local LLM server setup (LM Studio / Ollama)
     - Model downloads (exact versions, quantization levels)
     - Running the data collection pipeline
     - Expected output files and format

  3. Phase 2 Replication (Data Analysis — Python/Jupyter)
     - Option A: Google Colab (click "Open in Colab" badge)
     - Option B: Local Python environment
     - Required packages: pandas, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn
     - Running the analysis notebook
     - Verifying output matches published figures and tables

  4. Verification Checklist
     - How to confirm your results match the published findings
